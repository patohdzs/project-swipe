    "# Model One: Budget-Constrained Swiping\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "### Life, actions, and payoffs\n",
    "- In essence, the Tinder platform represents to an agent a sequence of suggested partners\n",
    "- The agent faces an infinite horizon, with time indexed as $t=1,2,...$ and a 'death rate' $(1-\\delta)$\n",
    "    - An agent can 'die' either because Tinder runs out of suggestions for her, or becuase she decides to quit\n",
    "- Each suggested partner can be viewed as a Bernoulli-type lottery with some corresponding attractiveness payoff drawn i.i.d from a beta distribution with c.d.f $F$ and a fixed probability of ‘right-swiping back’\n",
    "    - $\\left[\\,\\theta_t,0\\;;\\;\\rho,(1-\\rho)\\,\\right]$\n",
    "- For each suggestion, the agent decides whether to 'participate in the lottery'\n",
    "    - $a_t=\\begin{cases}1 & \\text{swipe right}\\\\0 & \\text{swipe left}\\end{cases}$\n",
    "- Given the agent participates, expected utility from matching is $U(\\theta_t,a_t ) = \\rho\\, a_tu(\\theta_t)$, where $u(\\cdot)$ is a v-NM utility function satisfying $u(0)=0$\n",
    "    - This is important because, if $u(0)<0$, then matching with some (ugly) people is worse than just skipping them\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Costly swiping\n",
    "- Left swiping is costly as the agent can die the next round, so why not swipe right on everyone?\n",
    "- Tinder makes right-swiping costly by placing a cap on the total number of right swipes for each user. We refer to this as the agent’s budget $b_t$   \n",
    "- The budget is evolves dynamically according to the law of motion:\n",
    "    - $b_{t+1}= b_t  - a_t$\n",
    "- The starting budget, $b_0$, is determined exogenously \n",
