\label{sec: figs tables algos}
\subsection{Setup} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Who are the players?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Disjoint sets of men and women in the platform
        \item They have attractiveness type $\mu,\omega \in [0,1]$
        \item They do not know (or care) about their own attractiveness.
    \end{itemize} 
    \item What do they do?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item They get anonymously and sequentially partnered up.
        \item To their knowledge, this happens in a random manner.
        \item They observe the suggestion's attractiveness 
        \item They can choose to swipe left or right, thus $\mathcal{A}=\{0,1\}$.
        \item If they both swipe right on each other, they match. Note this doesn't mean they leave.
    \end{itemize}
    \item What do they know?
    \begin{itemize}
        
        \item Equally agents face a cap on the number of right swipes they have
        \item $B_m$ for men and 
    \end{itemize}
    \item What are their preferences?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Players get no payoffs from not matching, and $u(\mu)$ or $u(\omega)$, where $u(\cdot)$ is increasing, concave, and crosses through the origin.
        \item This is evident since users can unmatch with each other, making all matches weakly preffered to non-matching.  
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{The Dating Market}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Entry flows
    \item Leaves (including geometric lifetime)
    \item Masses
    \item Distribution
    \item Steady State
\end{itemize}
\subsection{The Search Problem} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Present case for women, then say case for men follows
    \item Condition on male strategy and steady state
    \item Present Ex-interim utility maximization
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Show it reduces to a constant
    \end{itemize} 
    \item Present sequence problem
    \item Derive Bellman equation
    \item Prove uniqueness of value function and solution
    \item Derive solution
\end{itemize}
