It is widely considered that the search for love is an intricate and complex social phenomenon, and in today's world, swipe-based dating applications seem to only make it trickier. 
These platforms, best exemplified by Tinder or Bumbble, provide a gameified way of browsing through potential romantic partners by swiping through a stack of suggestions to indicate likes or dislikes, one profile at a time. 
In the search and matching literature, these fall under the category of decentralized two-sided matching markets with online search \citep{kanoria2021facilitating}, emphasising the fact that \textit{a)} both sides of the market are comprised of rational agents, \textit{b)} matches only occur given a double coincidence of wants, and \textit{c)} romantic suggestions are presented in a \textit{sequential} manner to users. 
These apps thus differ widely from traditional dating sites where users are centrally and statically matched (such as ...), but have come to dominate the modern love market, with Tinder boasting XXX million users as of 2021 and YYY million paid subscribers.


From a theoretical standpoint, these platforms introduce many additional complexities that, due to their novelty, have been sparsely studied in the economics literature, with these falling into two categories: those arising from platform features and those arising from the intrinsic nature of the problem. 
The first of these refers to platform-specific factors such as suggestion algorithms, matching technologies, swiping caps, and asynchronicity, which are often determined exogenously and pose significant constraints to the way utility-maximizing agents strategise their search process. 
On the other hand, the generalized problem of search is inherently complex as it involves a dynamic game of incomplete information where, even though the stage interaction is simple, its repetition demands consideration of 


Overall, the prevalence of these swipe-based dating apps in modern social interactions, the theoretical complexities they induce, and the largely understudied nature motivated this dissertation. 
Although many different questions can be asked regarding these platforms, answering these requires a fundamental understanding of how users make decisions in these platforms: to put it simply, \textit{when should a user swipe right?}. 
This paper will explore the above question in the setting of a swipe-based dating platform where agents on both 

formulating a game-theoretic model of two-sided search within these platforms along with a corresponding definition of equilibrium. 
Using numerical methods, I approximate the steady-state equilibria and perform comparative statics
