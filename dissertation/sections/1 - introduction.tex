\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:section1}
It is widely acknowledged that the search for love is a complex social phenomenon, but in today's world, swipe-based dating platforms (SBDP's) seem to only make it trickier.
These platforms, exemplified by Tinder, Bumble, or Hinge, provide a gamified way of browsing through potential romantic partners by swiping through a stack of suggested candidates to indicate likes or dislikes for these, one profile at a time.  
In the search and matching literature, settings like these fall under the category of decentralized two-sided matching markets \citep{kanoria2021facilitating} and, despite broad differences from traditional dating sites featuring centralized static matching, SBDP's have come to dominate the modern love market, with Tinder alone boasting 75 million monthly active users and 9.6 million paid subscribers as of 2021 \citep{web:tinder_stats}.

From a theoretical standpoint, search within SBDP's induces several complexities stemming from platform-specific features, such as swiping caps, asynchronicity, and directed search algorithms.
These impose non-trivial constraints on the way utility-maximising agents strategise their search, but they have been sparsely studied in the economics literature due to the relative novelty of these platforms.
Overall, the prevalent role of SBDP's in shaping modern romantic interactions and their largely understudied nature motivates many different questions.
Nevertheless, exploring these demands a fundamental understanding of how users make decisions in these platforms: to put it simply, \textit{when should a utility-maximising user swipe right?}

This dissertation will explore the above within an SBDP setting, where agents with heterogeneous preferences on both sides of the market search simultaneously for multiple romantic partners.
Crucially, I focus on explaining (what I refer to as) the `Fast-Swiping Males' puzzle: that is, the empirical observation that men in SBDP's respond with significantly higher swipe rates and face considerably worse matching outcomes than women. This phenomenon has been both a subject of empirical research \citep{tyson2016first} and a contentious discussion point within mainstream media \citep{web:vice_tindermen, web:wp_miserabletinder}, and yet a significant gap persists within the literature for a discussion of this through a theoretical lens \footnote{Among the surveyed literature, perhaps the only partial examination of this phenomenon is provided by \cite{kanoria2021facilitating}}. 
Such analysis would add significant value since the potential causes of this phenomenon (user patience, differential preferences, and strategic dominance) are all systematically endogenous with one another, thus demanding a rigorous model that can isolate these individual effects and capture their propagation across the SBDP market.
Fundamentally, I show how gender imbalances within the platform (which arise due to several exogenous factors) can explain the above disparities and, expanding on this, I model a possible intervention where the swiping cap ratio between sexes can be set in a socially-efficient manner.

This work presents two main contributions to existing literature on the topic. 
Firstly, it constitutes one of a handful of attempts to model the market configurations arising within SBDP's, which is unsurprising due to the novelty of these platforms, but important given their current social relevance. 
Furthermore, it distinguishes itself from these others by directly considering both the `Fast-Swiping Males' puzzle as well as the impact of swiping caps both as a constraint to the agent's search problem and a potential market correction mechanism.
Finally, this work provides an interesting case study for the use of computational methods within game theory, a field that has traditionally emphasised pure mathematical analysis. 
By pairing a rigorously-formulated model with numerical computations and agent-based simulations, this dissertation exemplifies how the two approaches, rather than being mutually exclusive, can be jointly applied to complicated questions, as computational methods enable quick explorations that can serve as a stepping stone towards formalising mathematical arguments.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In \autoref{sec:section2}, I outline the theoretical framework for the model developed in this paper, and derive necessary conditions for both the system steady state and the agent best-responses. In \autoref{sec:section3}, I present a refined definition for the steady state equilibrium of the model and perform computational comparative statics on several parameters, with the aim of replicating stylized empirical facts and explaining the `Fast-Swiping Males' phenomenon. In \autoref{sec:section4}, I utilize agent-based simulation methods to analyse the convergence and dynamics of my model, and present a discussion on socially-efficient budget interventions. Finally, \autoref{sec:section5} presents concluding remarks and outlines potential avenues for future research.

\subsection{Related Work}
The present work draws inspiration from two key branches of economics literature: that of search and matching, which studies the decision-making process of agents who seek, for example, a job, a business partner, or a spouse, and that of mean-field game theory, which models complex dynamic games involving a large number of players. 
I discuss each of these in turn, and then contrast this work with the handful of papers that have focused on specifically analysing SBDP market configurations.

Despite the abundance of papers within the search and matching literature, which has been amply surveyed by \cite{chade2017sorting}, I draw focus on works that consider the three defining features of SBDP markets: decentralised matching, two-sidedness, and non-transferable utility. 
A seminal paper at this intersection is that of \cite{burdett1997marriage}, which studies the marriage market for ex-ante heterogeneous agents under uniform random search, extending the work of \cite{becker1973theory} by showing that positive assortative matching can arise even in the absence of log-supermodularity.
Several extensions follow from this, considering settings with idiosyncratic preferences \citep{burdett1998two}, noisy attractiveness observations \citep{chade2006matching}, and even convergence onto the set of stable matchings \citep{adachi2003search}. 
The framework outlined in this dissertation is perhaps most similar to that of \cite{burdett1998two}, with three major distinctions. 
Firstly, the model formulated in this paper extends the above by allowing for multiple partners within a user's lifetime, a feature which was probably not significant within the labour market context considered by \cite{burdett1998two}, but which is nevertheless quintessential of SBDP's given their role in fomenting casual relationships.
Furthermore, I also extend the work of \citeauthor{burdett1998two} by allowing for sex-specific mass differences, as well as exogenous agent inflows; a point which of noted interest for the authors themselves, and which is fundamental when considering the effects of gender imbalances within the platform. 
Finally, my framework considers a discrete time framework, departing from \cite{burdett1998two} and most of the matching literature. 
Although continuous-time models provide sharper analysis and more flexible empirical specifications \citep{burdett1999long}, this modelling choice lends itself naturally to the use of agent-based simulations, which are used to explore equilibria convergence and dynamics in a richer manner. 

On the other hand, mean-field game theory focuses on dynamic games with a large number of agents, for which curses of dimensionality arise due to intractable state spaces \citep{light2022mean}. 
Mean-field models tackle this issue by considering interactions with the \textit{aggregate state} only, rather than interactions with all other players.
This simplification is cemented with a \textit{consistency check}, such that equilibria arises when rational play given an aggregate state maintains this same state as a fixed point. 
This approach, perhaps first considered by \cite{jovanovic1988anonymous}, has been successfully applied to settings such as network routing \citep{calderone2017markov}, dynamic auctions with learning \citep{iyer2014mean} and, perhaps most relevantly, online matching platforms \citep{kanoria2021facilitating,immorlica2021designing}.
In this paper, I rely on mean-field assumptions to abstract from observability considerations: within SBDP's, the market-wide history is unobservable to players, and thus traditional concepts such as Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium would require beliefs over history spaces, and even beliefs over the beliefs other players may hold (a complication known as nested beliefs \citep{brandenburger1993hierarchies}).
This yields two central problems: first, that equilibria become virtually impossible to compute, and, by extension, that the model assumes an unreasonable level of rationality on behalf of agents.
Thus, by considering interactions with the platform state, the model presented in this paper characterizes equilibria that are both insightful and representative of real-life behaviour and dynamics. 

Among the few papers specifically considering SBDP matching markets, \cite{kanoria2021facilitating} propose a two-sided dynamic matching model with vertically-differentiated agents, and show that platforms with unbalanced markets can improve welfare by forcing the short side to propose. 
Furthermore, \cite{immorlica2021designing} focus on the problem of determining a directed search algorithm in SBDP's through type-contingent meeting rates for agents. 
Both of these papers present theoretical models with similar features, and these have largely influenced my work in several ways; for example, by embedding mean-field assumptions that simplify the SBDP market from a game theoretical perspective. 
Despite this, there are three main differences between my work and above that are worth discussing. 


%Firstly, the action space in \cite{kanoria2021facilitating} is far richer as it allows agents to both issue and receive proposals to the other side. Whilst this permits a focused study of platforms such as Bumble or Coffee Meets Bagel, with user interactions that permit this, the model does not adjust naturally to mechanisms such as the one in Tinder, where agents do not know ex-ante if the other agent has swiped on them and must factor this within the strategic cost/benefit analysis of deciding to `spend a swipe'. This is important since one of the main selling points of Tinder paid subscriptions is the ability to observe which users have already swiped right on you, thus providing a strategic advantage. Furthermore, the two key platform interventions studied, in line with their elaborate action space, involve restricting one side of the market from proposing or hiding information regarding the quality types of agents.
