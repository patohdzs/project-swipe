Overall,  

\subsection{Future Work}
There are several interesting avenues for future research concerning SBDP matching platforms. Firstly, although I present a proof for the existence and uniqueness of agent best-responses,

- Evolutionary dynamics?
- Mixed preferences...
- Model that allows for both multiple casual matches and  long-term partnerships, after which agents leave the market
