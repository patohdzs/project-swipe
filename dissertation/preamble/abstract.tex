    \noindent In today's love market, swipe-based dating platforms (SBDPs) such as Tinder or Bumble have a well-established presence, but novel platform features can add significant complexities to the user's search problem in ways that have been largely under-studied in existing literature.
    This paper formulates a model of two-sided matching within SBDPs, where agents with heterogeneous preferences search for multiple romantic partners whilst facing intertemporal action constraints.
    Using numerical methods, I approximate equilibria at the steady-state and perform comparative statics on exogenous model parameters that help explain stylised empirical facts.
    Finally, agent-based simulations are used to asses the structure of steady-state equilibria as well as its attainability under myopic best-response dynamics.
