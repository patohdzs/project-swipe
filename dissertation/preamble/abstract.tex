    In today's love market, swipe-based dating apps have a well-established presence, but novel platform features can add significant complexities to the user's search problem in ways that have not been studied in existing literature.
    This paper formulates a game-theoretic model of two-sided search within swipe-based dating apps, along with an appropriately refined notion of equilibrium.
    Using numerical methods, I approximate equilibria at the steady-state and perform comparative statics on various model parameters to replicate and explain stylized facts observed in aggregate Tinder data. 
    Finally, agent-based simulations are used to analyse off-path dynamics and discuss how exogenous platform features (such as the matching algorithm and the swiping caps) can be set in a socially-efficient manner.
