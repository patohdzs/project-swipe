## Introduction{.smaller}
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- SBDP's and the modern dating market 
    - Agents are presented with suggestions to swipe left or right on.
    - Matches occur given a double coincidence of wants.

- Love is tricky; SBDP's make it worse... 
    - Dynamic interactions are harder due to repeated game complexities.
    - How do agents strategise their search? What outcomes emerge in equilibrium?

- The 'Fast-Swiping Men' puzzle
    - Men have higher swiping rates but face worse market outcomes... why?
    - Lots of empirical evidence, but no theoretical analysis.

## The stage interaction {.smaller}
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Fix a continuum of heteronormative male and female agents.
- Time is discrete and indexed by $t = 0, 1, 2, ...$
- Suggested partners have attractiveness type $\theta_t \in \Theta := [0, 1]$.
- Attractiveness is sampled i.i.d from absolutely continuous CDF's, $F_m, F_w$.
- Action space is $\mathcal{A} = \{1, 0\}$, where $a_t = 1$ indicates a right-swipe.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Matching payoff is given by $u(\theta_t)$, where $u(\cdot)$ is continuous, strictly increasing, and satisfies $u(0) = 0$.
- Agents are constrained by a *swiping budget* which evolves according to $b_{t+1}=b_t -a_t$.
- Focus (clarified later) is on pure symmetric stationary strategies, $\mu: \Theta \times\mathcal{B}_m\rightarrow \mathcal{A}$ for men and $\omega:\Theta \times\mathcal{B}_w\rightarrow \mathcal{A}$ for women.

## The dating market {.smaller}
- Let $N_{mt}(b), N_{wt}(b)$ denote the masses of men and women at specific budget levels.

- Each period, masses $\lambda_m, \lambda_w$ of men and women arrive in the market.

- When the market is imbalanced, agents are presented suggested partners according to Bernoulli process with probabilities: 

$$\tau_{mt} := \min \left\{\frac{\sum_{b\in\mathcal{B}_w}N_{wt}(b)}{\sum_{b\in\mathcal{B}_m}N_{mt}(b)} , 1 \right\},\quad \tau_{wt}:= \left(\frac{\sum_{b\in\mathcal{B}_m}N_{mt}(b)}{\sum_{b\in\mathcal{B}_w}N_{wt}(b)} \right) \tau_{mt}$$

- Lifetime is geometrically distributed with probability of death $(1-\delta)$.

- Focus on behaviour in the stationary market $\Psi=(N_m,N_w)$.

## Market stationarity conditions{.smaller}

- Balanced entry/exit into the market

$\lambda_w\;=\; \underbrace{ (1-\delta)\sum_{b\in\mathcal{B}_w}N_{w}(b)}_{\text{Exogenous Outflow}} \;+\; \underbrace{N_w(1) \int_{\Theta}  \tau_w \delta \, \omega(\theta,1)\,dF_{m}(\theta)}_{\text{Endogenous Outflow}}$

- Balanced entry/exit between budget levels

$\underbrace{N_w(b+1) \int_{\Theta} \tau_w \delta \,\omega(\theta,b+1)\,dF_{m}(\theta)}_{\text{Inflow into $b$}} \;=\; \underbrace{N_w(b) \Big( (1-\delta) \;+\;  \int_{\Theta} \tau_w \delta \, \omega(\theta,b)\,dF_{m}(\theta)\Big)}_{\text{Outflow from $b$}}$

- Balanced entry/exit at  the top budget level

$\lambda_w \;=\; \underbrace{N_w(B_w) \Big( (1-\delta) \;+\;  \int_{\Theta} \tau_w \delta \, \omega(\theta,B_w)\,dF_{m}(\theta) \Big)}_{\text{Outflow from $B_w$}}$

## Mean-field effects{.smaller}

- Consider the search problem of a woman searching in steady-state market $\Psi$.

- Towards a mean field assumption
    - Agents maximize *expected* utility, conditional on beliefs for all unknowns.
    - Beliefs over market histories are both infeasible and computationally intractable.
    

- Assume steady-state market and consider only the *average* interaction, then the ex-interim expected payoff is: $U(\theta,a) = \overline\mu a u(\theta)$.

- Multi-agent dynamic game collapses onto two Markov Decision Problems:

$$
    \begin{aligned} 
        V_w(\theta,b)=\max_{\{a_k\}^\infty_{k=0}} \quad & \mathbb{E}_{\theta}\left[\sum^\infty_{k=0} \delta^{k} U(\theta_k, a_k) \;|\; \theta_0=\theta, b_0=b\right]\\ 
        \textrm{s.t.} \quad & b_{k+1} = b_k - a_k \\
        & b_k\in \mathcal{B}_w \cup \{0\},\\
        & a_k\in \mathcal{A}  
    \end{aligned}
$$

## The search problem {.smaller}
- Let $\alpha := \frac{\delta \tau_w}{1-\delta(1-\tau_w)}$ be the *effective discount rate*, accounting for both the pairings and departures processes (agents must discount for both of these possibilities).
- The agent's search problem is then summarized by the Bellman Equation:
$$V_w(\theta,b) \;=\;\max\left \{\,\overline{\mu}  u(\theta) +\alpha \,\mathbb{E}_\theta \Big[V_w(\theta', b-1)\Big]\,,\; \alpha\,\mathbb{E}_\theta \Big[ V_w(\theta', b)\Big]\,\right\}$$

- **Theorem:** Fix some $b\in\mathcal{B}_w$. Then there exists some unique reservation value $\widetilde{\omega}_b\in \Theta$ such that $V_w(\theta,b)$ admits the following piecewise form over $\Theta$:  
    $$ \begin{split}
        V_w(\theta,b)=\begin{cases}
            \overline\mu u(\theta) +\alpha \,\mathbb{E}_{\theta}\Big[V_w(\theta', b-1)\Big],& \theta \geq \widetilde \omega_b \\[8pt]
            \alpha \,\mathbb{E}_{\theta}\Big[V_w(\theta', b)\Big],& \theta\leq\widetilde \omega_b
        \end{cases}\\[8pt]  
    \end{split} $$


## Towards an optimal policy {.smaller}
- **Corollary:** The threshold policy, $\widetilde\omega$, parametrised by $\{\widetilde\omega\}_{b\in \mathcal{B}_w}$, attains $V_w(\theta,b)$:
    $$
        \begin{split}
            \widetilde\omega(\theta,b)&=\begin{cases}
                \text{Swipe Right},\quad \theta\geq \widetilde{\omega}_b \\ 
                \text{Swipe Left}, \quad\theta< \widetilde\omega _b  
            \end{cases}   
        \end{split} $$
        
- **Theorem:** The set of reservation values for women, $\{\widetilde\omega_b\}_{b\in \mathcal{B}_w}$, uniquely satisfies the recurrence relation and initial condition below, over the budget set $\mathcal{B}_w$: 
    $$u(\widetilde \omega_b) \;=\; \alpha u(\widetilde \omega_b) F_m(\widetilde \omega_b) \;+\; \alpha u(\widetilde \omega_{b-1}) \Big[1- F_m(\widetilde \omega_{b-1})\Big] \;+\; \int^{\widetilde \omega_{b-1}}_{\widetilde \omega_b} \alpha u(\theta')\,dF_m(\theta')$$
    $$u(\widetilde\omega_1) \;=\; \alpha u(\widetilde\omega_1)F_m(\widetilde\omega_1) \;+\; \int^1_{\widetilde\omega_1}\alpha u(\theta')\,dF_m(\theta')$$

- Using this theorem, we can compute the optimal strategy.

## Towards equilibrium {.smaller}
- **Definition:** A Stationary Equilibrium (SE) is a triplet $(\mu^*, \omega^*, \Psi^*)$ such that:
    1. $\mu^*(\theta,b)$ attains $V_m(\theta,b),$ for all pairs $\theta, b \in \Theta \times \mathcal{B}_m$, given $\omega^*,\Psi^*$.
    
    2. $\omega^*(\theta,b)$ attains $V_w(\theta,b),$ for all pairs $\theta, b \in \Theta \times \mathcal{B}_w$, given $\mu^*,\Psi^*$.
    
    3. $\Psi^*$ satisfies the market stationarity conditions given the strategy profile $(\mu^*, \omega^*)$.

- What does this mean?
    - First two points require best-responses, conditional on market state.
    - Third point serves as a *consistency check*, requiring market stationarity for MF assumption to be valid.

- We can compute equilibria by solving a system of $2(|\mathcal{B}_m + \mathcal{B}_w +1|)$ equations
    - Optimal policy recurrence relations for each sex.
    - Market stationarity conditions.


## The 'Fast-Swiping Men' problem... 
- Why is it that men swipe more and match less?
- Our model allows for the influence of behavioural factors
    - Men could be less patient or more desperate (?)

- The case of gender imbalances
    - Currently, there's a 6:1 male-to-female ratio on Tinder... 
    - What effects can  market tightness have on agents' swiping behaviour?  
    - We calibrate our model to find out...

# The case of gender imbalances... 
![](../figures/mkt-cs.png){fig-align="center"}

# ... and a potential market correction 
![](../figures/mkt-cs-bdiff.png){fig-align="center"}

# Agent-based simulations
- Tool to study how *"...the macro arises from the micro"*.
- Useful in cases where our model is analytically complex.

- We find two main applications
    1. Analysing  *convergence* onto equilibria.
    2. Checking the robustness of this convergence under myopic best-response gameplay.

# Steady-state convergence...

# ... at the limiting case ...

# ... and under myopic best-responses

# Conclusions and future work {.smaller}
- What I did
    - Modelled strategic behaviour within SBDP markets.
    - Utilized the notion of stationary equilibria to explain empirical observations.
    - Analysed equilibrium convergence and robustness using ABM.

- Why it matters
    - Subscription pricing!
    - Utility gained from subscribing stems from reducing search frictions.
    - Opportunities for price discrimination.

- What next?
    - Search frictions due to type mismatch (casual dating vs. hookups).
    - Endogenising gender imbalance, perhaps by adding competing platform.
