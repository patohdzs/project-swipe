### Abstract
> In today's love market, swipe-based dating platforms (SBDPs) such as Tinder or Bumble have a well-established presence, but novel platform features can add significant complexities to the user's search problem in ways that have been largely under-studied in previous literature. This paper formulates a model of two-sided search within SBDPs, where agents with heterogeneous preferences seek multiple romantic partners whilst facing intertemporal action constraints. Using numerical methods, I approximate stationary equilibria and perform comparative statics on various exogenous parameters that help explain stylised empirical facts. Finally, agent-based simulations are used to asses the structure of stationary equilibria as well as its attainability under myopic best-response dynamics.
