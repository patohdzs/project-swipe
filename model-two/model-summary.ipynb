    "# Model Two: Two-Sided Strategic Search \n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "### The Stage Interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consider the search market formed by the Tinder platform with both male and female agents, indexed $m$ and $w$ respectively, looking for potential partners.\n",
    "- For ease of exposition, we assume that this market is heteronormative such that male agents search for female agents only and vice-versa.\n",
    "- Time is discrete and indexed $t=0,1,...$ over an infinite horizon\n",
    "- At every time period, agents from each sex are simultaneously presented a suggested partner from the opposite sex. \n",
    "- Each agent has an attractiveness type $\\theta_i,\\, i=m,w$ that is unknown to them but observable to their suggestion\n",
    "- Agents then choose whether to swipe left or right on their suggestion, thus $\\mathcal{A}_m=\\mathcal{A}_w=\\{ 0,\\; 1\\}$ where $1$ stands for swiping right\n",
    "    - If both agents swipe right, they are said to have *matched*\n",
    "    - If either agent swipes left, neither earns any payoff and they continue searching\n",
    "    - Notice that the suggested partner’s action is only *observable* if one swipes right\n",
    "- Upon matching, agents earn a payoff $u(\\theta_{-i}),\\, i=m,w$\n",
    "    - We assume $u(\\cdot)$ is strictly increasing, bounded, and satisfies $u(0)=0$ \n",
    "\n",
    "### Life, Death, and the Tinder Market\n",
    "\n",
    "- The masses of men and women on Tinder at any given time period $t$ are denoted by $N^t_{m}$ and $N^t_{w}$, respectively.\n",
    "- Each period, $\\lambda_m$ new men and $\\lambda_w$ new women arrive\n",
    "    - The attractiveness of new male and female users is drawn i.i.d from exogenous distributions with c.d.f’s $F_m$ and $F_w$ respectively\n",
    "- Agents leave the platform in two ways:\n",
    "    - Exogenously (ie. they ‘die’) at a rate of $(1-\\delta)$ \n",
    "    - Endogenously, when they exhaust their budgets\n",
    "- Given sample spaces $\\Theta_{m}\\times \\mathcal{B}_{m}$ and $\\Theta_{w}\\times \\mathcal{B}_{w}$, let $\\mathbb{P}_{m}$ and $\\mathbb{P}_{w}$ be the probability measures over the corresponding $\\sigma$-algebras\n",
    "    - Let $M^t,W^t:\\Theta_{m,w}\\times\\mathcal{B}_{m,w}\\rightarrow[0,1]$ be the joint distributions over agents in the platform, defined as:\n",

    "### Budgeted Swiping\n",
    "\n",
    "- Left swiping is costly as the agent can die the next round, so why not swipe right on everyone?\n",
    "- Tinder makes right-swiping costly by placing a cap on the total number of right swipes for each user. We refer to this as the agent’s budget $b_t$\n",
    "- The budget is evolves dynamically according to the law of motion:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    b_{t+1}= b_{t}- a_{t}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The starting budgets for each sex, $B_{m}$ and $B_{w}$, are determined exogenously\n",
    "- Given this, an agent’s decision on any given time period depends fundamentally on the attractiveness of the suggested partner and their own budget\n",
    "- We only consider stationary Markov strategies, defines for men as functions $\\mu:\\Theta_w \\times\\mathcal{B}_m\\rightarrow \\Delta\\mathcal{A}_m$ and for women as $\\omega:\\Theta_m \\times\\mathcal{B}_w\\rightarrow \\Delta\\mathcal{A}_w$\n",

    "\n",
    "## The Steady State Market\n",
    "\n",
    "- When talking steady state we omit time subscripts to denote stationarity\n",
    "- The steady state components are endogenously determined since the flow of agents into lower budget levels (and eventually out of the market) depends on their swiping decisions\n",
    "- Denote by $M(\\cdot\\,;\\mu,\\omega)$, $W(\\cdot\\,;\\mu,\\omega)$ the endogenous steady-state joint c.d.f’s for men and women that arise given the strategies $\\mu$ and $\\omega$\n",
    "- $N_m(\\mu,\\omega),N_w(\\mu,\\omega)$ are defined analogously\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theorem 1: Steady State Characterisation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fix some strategies $\\mu, \\omega$ and let the expected probabilities of a right swipe be:\n",
